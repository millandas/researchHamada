Goal: Build a robust, automated, and reproducible data science workflow for emission projection
and transition risk analysis.
Example Project: Develop and deploy a modeling pipeline to estimate and project company or
sector emissions under different IEA scenarios.
Tasks:
• Design an end-to-end data pipeline: ingestion, cleaning, feature engineering, modeling,
and output generation.
• Implement version-controlled and modular code for traceability and reproducibility.
• Automate data updates and scenario runs using notebooks, scripts, or workflow managers.
• Deploy trained models or analytical scripts in a lightweight, production-ready format (e.g.,
API endpoint, reproducible notebook, or Git repository).
• Ensure consistent storage and documentation of input data, models, and results for future
reuse.
Deliverables:
• Technical or methods section in Overleaf (architecture diagram, modeling workflow, data
sources).
• Reproducible pipeline or deployment demonstration (GitHub link, notebook, or mock API).
• Contribution to the final presentation: value offered = automated, production-ready data
pipeline enabling scalable climate analytics.
Skills: Data engineering, ML/statistical modeling, version control, model deployment,
reproducible research.
